# banner_access_control
An interface for Banner's functional analysts and Banner security.

Make a fork of **DarinUWIMSc/banner_access_control** and then clone it to your localhost. Once you've cloned your fork you will be able to sync and commit your changes to that fork you've created. Be sure to sync and commit very often, however, you should only commit code that works.

Your edits will be merged to the **develop** branch. You can then send a **Pull Request** so that I may try to add it back to the main branch.
